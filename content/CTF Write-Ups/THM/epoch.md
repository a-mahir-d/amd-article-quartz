<b>VISIT WEB PAGE</b>

If we read the room explanation "Our website actually just passes your input right along to that command-line program!" we can see that we might be able to run commands. So lets try it.

Perfect, we can run commands. Lets find a way to get in.

Visit https://www.revshells.com/ and use your pc's IP to handle the condiguration.

run "nc -lvnp 9001"

<b>GET THE FLAG</b>

When we look around we can not find the flag. Lets look at the hint: "The developer likes to store data in environment variables, can you find anything of interest there?"

Lets try "printenv" to see the environment variables.
